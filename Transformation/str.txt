I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all
the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness ? that
terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable
lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring
vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined.
